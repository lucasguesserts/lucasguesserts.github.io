This tutorial introduces the Knapsack problem, present models to solve it, and compares them. It goes in depth on the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) and the optimization of its parameters using irace.

## The Knapsack Problem

The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the value in a knapsack with limited capacity by placing valuable items into it.

### Mathematical Formulation

Let:

1. $I$ be a set of items;
2. $w_i \in \mathbb{Z}^*_+$ be the weight of item $i \in I$;
3. $p_i \in \mathbb{Z}^*_+$ be the profit of item $i \in I$;
4. $c \in \mathbb{Z}^*_+$ be the capacity of the knapsack;
5. $x_i$ be a binary variable that indicates if item $i \in I$ is in the knapsack;

(Notice that one specified the values of $w_i$, $p_i, c$ to be integers for simplicity, but the problem can be generalized to real numbers.)

The knapsack problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming problem as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \max & \sum_{i \in I} p_i x_i \\\\
    \text{subject to} & \sum_{i \in I} w_i x_i \leq c \\\\
    & x_i \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i \in I
\end{align*}
$$

To avoid trivial cases, all instances to be tested will satisfy:

1. the total weight of all items exceeds the capacity of the knapsack: $c < \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i \in I} w_i$;
2. all items fits, alone, into the knapsack: $\forall i \in I \left(w_i \leq c\right)$.

## Instances

Here we are going to use the instances generated by [Jorik Jooken, Pieter Leyman, Patrick De Causmaecker](#instances-generation). We are not going into the details of how the instances are generated, but the authors claim that they are hard instances for the 0-1 knapsack problem. For more information, see the authors' paper.

The [appendix](#selected-instances) contains a list of the instances selected for this tutorial.

## Models

The focus here is to solve the problem using BRKGA. However, for comparison purposes, two other models are going to be developed:

1. greedy algorithm;
2. integer linear programming;
3. BRKGA;

### Greedy

Associate to each item $i \in I$ a relative profit value $r_i = \dfrac{p_i}{w_i}$. Sort the items in decreasing order of $r_i$. Then, add the items to the knapsack in this order until the capacity is reached.

### Integer Linear Programming

The integer linear programming model is the same as the one presented in the [Mathematical Formulation section](#mathematical-formulation). It can be implemented with any optimization solver for integer linear programming. I chose to use Gurobi 11.

### BRKGA

We need to specify some things:

1. the gene:
   1. it will be a list of real numbers in the interval $[0, 1]$;
   2. each allele will represent the order in which the items are going to be added to the knapsack (items with high value are going to be added first);
2. how to decode the genes into a fitness value;
   1. sort the items in decreasing order of the gene values;
   2. add the items to the knapsack in this order until the capacity is reached;
   3. return the total profit of the items in the knapsack as the fitness value;
3. the parameters of the algorithm, as required by the , summarized in the Table 2;

## Run the models and display quality of the solutions

The results are in the Table 3 below. Notice that, for the instances 1, 2, and 3, BRGKA found the optimal solution. For instance 4, it performed better than the Greedy Algorithm. However, for the instance 5, its performance was worse than the Greedy Algorithm.

## Explain irace

Are there other tools that do the same thing?
